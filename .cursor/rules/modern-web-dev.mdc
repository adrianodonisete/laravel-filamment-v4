# Your rule content

- Use semantic HTML5 elements for structure and accessibility.
- Write modular, maintainable, and reusable code (components, functions, styles).
- Prefer CSS utility frameworks (like Tailwind CSS) or CSS-in-JS for scalable styling.
- Optimize assets (images, fonts, scripts) for performance.
- Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes and devices.
- Follow accessibility (a11y) best practices (labels, ARIA, contrast, keyboard navigation).
- Use version control (git) and meaningful commit messages.
- Write automated tests for critical features and user flows.
- Minimize client-side JavaScript and leverage server-side rendering or static generation when possible.
- Keep dependencies up to date and monitor for security vulnerabilities.
- Use environment variables for configuration, never hardcode secrets.
- Document code, APIs, and architectural decisions clearly.
